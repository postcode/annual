	      <h1>2013 was a big and busy year.</h1>
	      <p class="align-right">In the year when Healthcare.gov crashed and burned, then found its way, the Code for America community explored what it means when interfaces to government are decidedly NOT simple, beautiful, or easy to use&mdash;when they stand between you and feeding your family, healthcare, or even your freedom. Fellows working in Louisville and New York City delved into the criminal justice system; in the Bay Area, teams tackled access to food assistance and other social services; and across the country, members of the network went deeper into the core challenges facing our cities in the 21st century.</p>
	      <p class="align-right">These experiences remind us whatâ€™s at stake in our work&mdash;and what's possible&mdash;and we begin 2014 with a deepened commitment to work on what matters.</p>
